    <string name="patchnotesOverviewText">The latest RechenMax version brings exciting improvements and features. Automatic scrolling makes it easier to navigate large calculations, while the rounding precision has been increased to the eleventh decimal place for more precise decimal numbers. History has been optimized to effortlessly restore previous calculations and review past tasks. In trigonometric tasks, advanced functions for sine, cosine and tangent in degrees and radians are available. Inverse trigonometric functions (sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, tan⁻¹) as well as hyperbolic functions such as sinh(x), cosh(x) and tanh(x) are now also available. Manual notation entry provides additional flexibility when creating and calculating complex expressions. The RechnenMax now supports the use of the mathematical constant PI (π) for precise circle calculations. With the flexible support of degrees and radians, you can switch between the two units of measurement as needed. Brackets handling has been optimized to ensure error-free processing of mathematical or logical expressions. The software automatically detects and adds missing closing brackets, further simplifying expression entry. In history, long-pressing on an entry allows the invoice to be automatically copied to the clipboard, while short-pressing pastes the invoice directly into the calculator. This release also fixes important bugs, including display and factorial calculation issues, as well as optimized result formatting for more accurate display.</string>

    <string name="calculationAreas">Calculation areas</string>
    <string name="calculationArea">1: This area (calculation area) displays the calculation you entered. You can also copy the contents of the area by long-pressing the area. 2: The result of the calculation carried out is displayed in this area (result area). You can also copy the contents of the area by long-pressing the area.</string>
    <string name="calculateText">After you have completed your calculation, press the \'=\' key to calculate the result. The result will then be displayed for you in the results area. This simple procedure allows you to get the results of your calculations quickly and easily.</string>
    <string name="calculate">Calculate</string>
    <string name="calculationModeText">With this setting you can specify whether the entries are first displayed in the results area and then inserted into the calculation area using an operator (standard), or whether they are written directly in the calculation area (simplified).</string>
    <string name="calculationMode">Calculation mode</string>

    <string name="numberField">Number field</string>
    <string name="numberFieldText">In this area you can click on numbers to gradually add them to the current result in the results area. This allows you to easily put together your desired combination of numbers and shows you transparently how the result changes with each selection.</string>

    <string name="history">History</string>
    <string name="callUpHistory">Call up history</string>
    <string name="callUpHistoryText">In the action bar you will find the history button, which allows you to access and view your previous calculations. This handy button makes it easier for you to quickly find your previous calculations and refer back to them when needed, whether to check results or repeat previous calculations.</string>
    <string name="editHistoryText">You can view previous calculations in the history. The delete button (top right) clears the entire history, the back button (top left) returns to the calculator. A long press copies a calculation to the clipboard, a short press pastes it into the calculator, and a double tap deletes a single calculation.</string>
    <string name="historyIsEmpty">Your history is empty.</string>
    <string name="editHistory">Edit history</string>

    <string name="settingsText">Various settings with detailed descriptions are available to you here. If you want to go back to the home page, just use the button at the top left. In addition, you will find the button at the top right that will take you to the introduction to the calculator. This means you can easily access the functions and information you want.</string>
    <string name="callUpSettingsText">If you go back to the home page, you will find the Settings button. If you press it you will be redirected to the calculator settings.</string>

    <string name="removeBack">Remove/Back</string>
    <string name="removeBackText">For precise editing, various delete functions are available: \'⌫\' removes the last number or character entered from the result area, \'CE\' deletes the entire result area and \'C\' empties both the result and calculation areas.</string>

    <string name="enableScientificMode">Enable scientific mode</string>
    <string name="enableScientificModeText">To activate scientific mode, simply press the corresponding button in the top left. This will reveal additional features.</string>

    <string name="advancedFeatures">Advanced features</string>
    <string name="moreFunctionText">When scientific mode is enabled, additional features appear. At the top left you see two arrows, next to them a number (1, 2 or 3) and the mode \'Deg\' or \'Rad\'. Using the arrows and the selected mode indicated by the number, you can switch between scientific mode modes, which contain different functions. In addition, you can set the degree with \'Deg\' and the radian with \'Rad\'. \'(\': Puts an open bracket in the calculation area. \')\': Puts a closed bracket in the calculation area. \'x!\': Takes the entered number from the result area and inserts it with the factorial character. \'√x\': The root of the number that comes from the result range. \'e\': Euler\'s number (approx. 2.7182)</string>
    <string name="moreFunctions">More functions</string>
    <string name="functionText">The \'Degrees / Radians\' setting allows you to choose between two common units of measurement for angles: degrees and radians. One degree divides the angle into 360 parts, which form a full circle. In radians, angle is measured based on the radius of a circle. A full circle is equal to 2π radians, where π is approximately 3.14159. A right angle is π/2 radians. Radians allow precise relationships between angle and circle radius and are used in advanced mathematical calculations.</string>
